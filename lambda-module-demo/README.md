This demo uses the aws lambda module. 
The module simplifies the lambda definition by including many resources internally.

1. Lambda with dependencies
2. Fully automatic deployment. Zero manual steps. 
3. API Gateway setup (with output printed upon `tf apply`)


Theoretically, you can hook an express app
